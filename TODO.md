## Branding

- [x] Experiment with new logo -> See [logo directory](logo/drafts.svg)

## Switching Tech Stacks

- [ ] Analyze advantages and disadvantages of a move to a technology like Jekyll
      or React or Angular
- [ ] Figure out where we would host the site

  - Integrating Bootstrap?

## Redesign

- [ ] Consider a move to a Jekyll + Material website
  - We will have to make it super easy for non-coding users to use. The most
    they should have to know is how to use Markdown; even better would be to
    have them write things in Google Docs and have it automatically show up on
    the website.
- [ ] Write a design doc

## External

- [ ] Fix description on
      [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Viterbi_School_of_Engineering#Viterbi_Graduate_Students_Association_(VGSA)>)
