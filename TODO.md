## Defunct

_Do not implement_

- [ ] Add [WordPress GitHub Sync](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-github-sync/)
  - This plugin does not work with organization repos
- [ ] Unpublish all the nonessential pages, then slowly add it back
  - We should just keep things up.
- [ ] Use a list of events on the Events page of the website rather than a
      calendar
  - We can use Google Calendar
