Welcome to the USC Viterbi School of Engineering (VSOE). We, the Viterbi
Graduate Student Association (VGSA), are glad that you have decided to join the
Trojan Family.

With such a large and diverse population at USC, students are presented with the
opportunity to enrich their experience by learning about a multitude of
cultures. Learning to understand and respect cultures that are different from
your own provides invaluable skills that are needed in the real world.

The engineering profession is becoming increasingly important in today's
technology-driven world. As a result, the Viterbi School of Engineering has been
constantly growing and evolving. Students may find it a challenge to become
acclimated and involved in such a large engineering community. And this is where
VGSA plays a major role. VGSA promotes interaction among the graduate students
in the Viterbi School of Engineering by hosting various academic and social
activities. Some of our activities, such as the Chinese Moon Festival and Music
of the World, spread cultural awareness, while other activities like the Viterbi
Ball, Tailgates, and Engineering Idol provide fun and excitement. One of VGSA's
foremost goals is to facilitate a safe, open environment at events for all
engineering students so that they might meet fellow students and members of
industry.

VGSA strives to address the needs and concerns of graduate engineering students
by holding elections every semester for department representatives. Every VGSA
member is dedicated to enhancing the academic and cultural experience of the
graduate students of Viterbi. In short, we are here to support you during your
stay in the Viterbi School.

We look forward to meeting you at our upcoming events. Fight On!
