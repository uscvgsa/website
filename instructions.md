# Instructions

Instructions for various tasks.

## Instagram Feed

We use the [Instagram Feed plugin](https://smashballoon.com/instagram-feed/) by
Smash Balloon. See the settings under "Instagram Feed" on the left navigation
panel. To insert the Instagram feed into a page, add the widget text
`[instagram-feed]`. Something interesting we noticed was that without the
`Load initial posts with AJAX,` setting, the Instagram images were very weird --
some of them extended to 2x their length. Thus, we keep this setting on.

## Facebook Feed

Currently, we do not have the Facebook Feed on the website, but in the past, we
used the [Facebook Feed plugin](https://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/)
by Smash Balloon.

## Google Calendar

To add the Google Calendar to the website, we simply use an embed code. See
[here](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/41207) for more info.
